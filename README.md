## About this Project
This is a TIA Add-In, what is a way to embed functions to your TIA Portal. No additional external applications are required to run TIA Add-Ins (See how to use it [here](#About)).

This project is based on a *Siemens AG - SIMATIC Systems Support project:* ***109773999_TIA_Add-In_VCI_Git_Connector_1.0.0_CODE***, to witch functions were added and modified.

With this Add-In you can connect the *Version Control Interface* of TIA with a git repository and then use all git's power on your project.
